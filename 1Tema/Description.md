# Budapest Weather Forecast Project

This project provides weather forecasts specifically for Budapest from 1999 to 2023. It employs two forecasting methods: linear regression and Random Forest.

## Forecasting Methods

- **Linear Regression:** Utilizes a linear model to predict weather trends based on historical data.
- **Random Forest:** Employs an ensemble learning method to predict weather patterns by constructing a multitude of decision trees.

## Analytic Graphs

This project includes various analytic graphs to assess the performance of both forecasting methods:

- **Scatter Plot:** Displays the relationship between predicted and actual weather values.
- **Residual Plot:** Illustrates the distribution of residuals to evaluate the goodness of fit.
- **Distribution of Errors:** Provides insights into the distribution of errors for both forecasting methods.
- **Linear Regression Plot:** Graphically represents the linear regression model.
- **Random Forest Regressor Plot:** Visualizes the Random Forest regression model.

Despite the models' limited accuracy, this project serves as a fundamental demonstration of weather forecasting using basic techniques.
